# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Phase**: dbt Implementation and Dashboard Development (Days 5-9)
- **Status**: Kestra workflow implemented and working, now implementing dbt models for dashboards
- **Overall Progress**: ~60% (Infrastructure and data ingestion pipeline complete)

## What Works
- Memory Bank has been initialized with core project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
  - Active Context
- Core repository structure set up according to PRD requirements
- Terraform configurations created for GCP resources:
  - GCS bucket for raw AIS data
  - BigQuery datasets for staging and curated data
  - API enablement for required services
- Makefile implemented for streamlining common operations
- README created with setup instructions and architecture overview
- Kestra workflow successfully implemented as the primary orchestration tool:
  - Configured YAML-based workflow for the ETL process
  - Implemented tasks for downloading, extracting, and processing AIS data
  - Set up detailed BigQuery schema definitions
  - Configured proper partitioning and table creation
  - Implemented error handling and proper task dependencies
  - Successfully loading data to BigQuery
- Initial dbt models established:
  - Staging model for cleaning and standardizing raw data
  - Curated model with business logic and enriched fields
  - Partitioning and clustering configured for performance

## What's In Progress
- Creating additional dbt models for dashboard aggregations
- Preparing for Looker Studio dashboard development
- Planning dashboard visualizations for navigational status

## What's Left to Build

### Revised Implementation Plan

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - [x] Create repository structure
   - [x] Write Terraform configurations for GCP resources
   - [x] Set up Makefile for common operations
   - [x] Provision GCP resources
   - [x] Verify infrastructure connectivity

2. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - [x] Implement Kestra workflow for data ingestion
   - [x] Configure extraction and loading tasks
   - [x] Set up BigQuery schema and table creation
   - [x] Test workflow execution and data loading

3. **dbt Implementation (Current Phase)**
   - [x] Configure initial staging and curated models
   - [ ] Create mart models for dashboard aggregations:
     - [ ] Daily navigational status distribution
     - [ ] Monthly navigational status distribution
   - [ ] Implement appropriate tests
   - [ ] Verify transformations with actual data

4. **Integration & Testing**
   - [ ] Validate end-to-end pipeline execution
   - [ ] Test with real-world data volumes
   - [ ] Optimize query performance
   - [ ] Create data quality validations

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - [ ] Connect Looker Studio to BigQuery
   - [ ] Create pie chart for daily navigational status
   - [ ] Create visualization for monthly status distribution
   - [ ] Implement interactive filtering
   - [ ] Format and publish dashboard

6. **Documentation & Finalization**
   - [x] Create initial README
   - [ ] Document all setup and execution steps in detail
   - [ ] Update architecture diagrams to reflect Kestra usage
   - [ ] Final quality review and submission

## Known Issues
- Need to optimize query performance for dashboard visualizations
- Final dbt models need to be tailored specifically for dashboard requirements
- Need to determine appropriate time granularity for monthly status visualization

## Next Steps
1. Create dbt mart models for dashboard aggregations
2. Test transformations with actual data
3. Begin Looker Studio dashboard development
4. Implement appropriate filters and interactivity

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented Kestra workflow for AIS data ingestion
- Configured proper BigQuery schema and table creation
- Established data loading pipeline from source to BigQuery
- Created initial dbt models for data transformation
- Updated project documentation to reflect current status
