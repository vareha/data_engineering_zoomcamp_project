# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Infrastructure Implementation (Days 1-2)
- **Status**: Core infrastructure code in place
- **Overall Progress**: ~20% (Infrastructure setup in progress)

## What Works
- Memory Bank has been initialized with core project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
  - Active Context
- Core repository structure set up according to PRD requirements
- Terraform configurations created for GCP resources:
  - GCS bucket for raw AIS data
  - BigQuery datasets for staging and curated data
  - API enablement for required services
- Makefile implemented for streamlining common operations
- README created with setup instructions and architecture overview

## What's In Progress
- GCP infrastructure provisioning (pending user credentials)
- Preparation for Airflow DAG development

## What's Left to Build

### Implementation Plan (Following PRD Timeline)

1. **Infrastructure Setup (Days 1-2)**
   - [x] Create repository structure
   - [x] Write Terraform configurations for GCP resources
   - [x] Set up Makefile for common operations
   - [x] Provision GCP resources
   - [x] Verify infrastructure connectivity

2. **Airflow DAG (Days 3-4)**
   - [ ] Create docker-compose for local Airflow
   - [ ] Develop core DAG structure
   - [ ] Implement ingestion steps (download, extract, load)
   - [ ] Test with sample data and implement error handling

3. **dbt Implementation (Days 5-6)**
   - [ ] Create project structure and configuration
   - [ ] Implement staging models
   - [ ] Implement curated models with partitioning
   - [ ] Create basic data quality tests

4. **Integration & Testing (Days 7-8)**
   - [ ] Connect Airflow to GCP resources
   - [ ] Validate end-to-end pipeline execution
   - [ ] Test with real-world data volumes
   - [ ] Optimize query performance

5. **Dashboard (Day 9)**
   - [ ] Connect Looker Studio to BigQuery
   - [ ] Create categorical distribution visualization
   - [ ] Create temporal distribution visualization
   - [ ] Format and publish dashboard

6. **Documentation (Day 10)**
   - [x] Create initial README
   - [ ] Document all setup and execution steps in detail
   - [ ] Complete infrastructure diagram
   - [ ] Final quality review and submission

## Known Issues
- No infrastructure has been provisioned yet (waiting for GCP credentials)
- Need to determine the exact source for AIS ZIP files

## Next Steps
1. Obtain GCP service account credentials
2. Run `make tf-apply` to provision GCP resources
3. Verify resources are created correctly
4. Prepare for Airflow development (Days 3-4)

## Recent Achievements
- Created repository structure based on PRD requirements
- Implemented Terraform configurations for all required GCP resources
- Developed Makefile with targets for common operations
- Created README with setup instructions and architecture overview
- Prepared example Terraform variables file
