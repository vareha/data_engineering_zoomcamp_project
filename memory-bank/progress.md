- Makefile implemented for streamlining common operations
- README created with setup instructions and architecture overview
- Kestra workflow successfully implemented as the primary orchestration tool:
  - Configured YAML-based workflow for the ETL process
  - Implemented tasks for downloading, extracting, and processing AIS data
  - Set up detailed BigQuery schema definitions
  - Configured proper partitioning and table creation
  - Implemented error handling and proper task dependencies
  - Successfully loading data to BigQuery
- Complete dbt implementation with multi-layer model architecture:
  - Staging models for initial data cleaning and type conversion
  - Intermediate model with deduplication and data quality enhancements
  - Mart models for dashboard-specific aggregations:
    - Daily navigational status distribution model for pie charts
    - Monthly navigational status model for time series analysis
  - Custom tests and comprehensive documentation
  - Partitioning and clustering configured for performance
- Self-hosted Metabase dashboard infrastructure set up:
  - Docker Compose configuration for quick deployment
  - Setup script for easy installation
  - Example SQL queries for all required visualizations
  - Detailed implementation guide with step-by-step instructions
  - Complete README with setup and troubleshooting tips

## What's In Progress
- Implementing Metabase dashboards based on the implementation guide
- Finalizing project documentation
- Testing the end-to-end Metabase dashboard functionality

## What's Left to Build

### Revised Implementation Plan

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - [x] Create repository structure
   - [x] Write Terraform configurations for GCP resources
   - [x] Set up Makefile for common operations
   - [x] Provision GCP resources
   - [x] Verify infrastructure connectivity

2. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - [x] Implement Kestra workflow for data ingestion
   - [x] Configure extraction and loading tasks
   - [x] Set up BigQuery schema and table creation
   - [x] Test workflow execution and data loading

3. **dbt Implementation**
   - [x] Configure initial staging and curated models
   - [x] Create mart models for dashboard aggregations:
     - [x] Daily navigational status distribution
     - [x] Monthly navigational status distribution
   - [x] Implement appropriate tests
   - [x] Fix test failures and data quality issues
   - [x] Verify transformations with actual data

4. **Integration & Testing**
   - [x] Validate end-to-end pipeline execution
   - [x] Test with real-world data volumes
   - [x] Optimize query performance
   - [x] Create data quality validations

5. **Dashboard Development (Current Phase)**
   - [x] Create detailed Metabase implementation guide
   - [x] Set up Docker-based Metabase infrastructure
   - [x] Create SQL query templates for visualizations
   - [ ] Set up Metabase connection to BigQuery
   - [ ] Create pie chart for daily navigational status
   - [ ] Create visualization for monthly status distribution
   - [ ] Implement interactive filtering
   - [ ] Format and publish dashboard

6. **Documentation & Finalization**
   - [x] Create initial README
   - [ ] Document all setup and execution steps in detail
   - [ ] Update architecture diagrams to reflect Kestra usage
   - [ ] Final quality review and submission

## Known Issues
- Need to optimize query performance for dashboard visualizations
- Final dbt models need to be tailored specifically for dashboard requirements
- Need to determine appropriate time granularity for monthly status visualization

## Next Steps
1. Launch and configure the Metabase instance using the setup script
2. Create dashboards following the Metabase implementation guide
3. Implement interactive filtering and optimizations
4. Finalize all documentation
5. Complete final checks and prepare for submission

## Recent Achievements

- Established data loading pipeline from source to BigQuery
- Created comprehensive dbt models with all tests passing 
- Implemented deduplication for unique_row_id values in the intermediate layer
- Fixed test macro to properly handle valid zero counts and NULL values
- Switched dashboard approach from Looker Studio to self-hosted Metabase
- Created Docker-based Metabase setup with deployment script
- Developed SQL query templates for all required visualizations
- Created comprehensive Metabase implementation guide
- Updated project documentation to reflect current status
- Successfully tested end-to-end data flow through the entire pipeline
