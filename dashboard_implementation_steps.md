# Dashboard Implementation Steps

## Overview
This document outlines the steps for creating Looker Studio dashboards based on the implemented dbt models.

## Available dbt Models

### 1. Intermediate Model
- **Model Name**: `int_ais_data`
- **Description**: Cleaned and standardized AIS data with data quality flags
- **Key Features**:
  - Handles duplicate unique_row_id values
  - Standardizes field formats (datetime, coordinates, etc.)
  - Extracts date components for easier filtering
  - Includes data quality flags (has_valid_position, has_valid_mmsi)
  - Calculates vessel dimensions from different source fields

### 2. Daily Navigational Status Model
- **Model Name**: `daily_navigational_status`
- **Description**: Daily aggregation of navigational statuses for pie chart visualization
- **Key Features**:
  - Aggregates data by date and navigational status
  - Includes record counts and percentages
  - Partitioned by date for efficient filtering
  - Clustered by navigational status for query optimization

### 3. Monthly Navigational Status Model
- **Model Name**: `monthly_navigational_status`
- **Description**: Monthly aggregation of navigational statuses for time series visualization
- **Key Features**:
  - Aggregates data by year, month, and navigational status
  - Uses month_start_date (first day of each month) for easy partitioning
  - Includes record counts and percentages
  - Optimized for time-based queries with proper partitioning

## Dashboard Creation Steps

### Step 1: Connect Looker Studio to BigQuery
1. Create a new Looker Studio report
2. Add a data source
3. Select BigQuery connector
4. Choose your GCP project (`de-zoomcamp-project-455806`)
5. Select the mart models (`marts.daily_navigational_status` and `marts.monthly_navigational_status`)

### Step 2: Create Daily Navigational Status Visualization (Pie Chart)
1. Add a pie chart visualization
2. Configure data source to use `daily_navigational_status`
3. Dimension: `navigational_status`
4. Metric: `percentage` or `record_count`
5. Add a date filter control to allow filtering by specific dates
6. Recommended style settings:
   - Show legend
   - Add data labels to show percentages
   - Use a consistent color palette
   - Add title: "Daily Navigational Status Distribution"

### Step 3: Create Monthly Navigational Status Visualization (Time Series)
1. Add a time series chart visualization
2. Configure data source to use `monthly_navigational_status`
3. Dimension: `month_start_date`
4. Breakdown Dimension: `navigational_status`
5. Metric: `percentage` or `record_count`
6. Add date range control to allow filtering by time period
7. Recommended style settings:
   - Show legend
   - Use stacked columns or stacked area chart for better visualization
   - Add title: "Monthly Navigational Status Trends"

### Step 4: Add Interactive Elements
1. Create a dashboard filter that connects to both visualizations
   - Add a control based on `navigational_status` to filter both charts by specific status
2. Add a text box to explain the visualizations
3. Consider adding a summary metric card showing total records represented

### Step 5: Optimize Performance
1. Configure data freshness settings in Looker Studio:
   - Set an appropriate cache duration based on data update frequency
2. Apply default date filters to limit initial data load
3. Consider creating additional aggregated models if performance issues arise

## Best Practices
1. **Consistent Formatting**: Use the same color palette and styling across visualizations
2. **Clear Labels**: Ensure all axes and data points are clearly labeled
3. **Context**: Add descriptive text explaining what each visualization represents
4. **Interactivity**: Allow users to drill down into specific time periods or statuses
5. **Performance**: Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

## Troubleshooting
- If visualizations are slow to load, check:
  - Query complexity
  - Data volume
  - Partitioning/clustering effectiveness
- If data appears incorrect:
  - Verify dbt models are running correctly
  - Check for proper filtering in the dashboard
  - Ensure data refreshes are working

## Next Steps
After creating the initial dashboard, consider:
1. Adding additional visualizations like maps for spatial distribution
2. Creating separate dashboards for different user personas
3. Setting up scheduled email reports for stakeholders
4. Implementing additional drill-down capabilities
