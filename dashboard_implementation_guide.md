# Looker Studio Dashboard Implementation Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing Looker Studio dashboards based on the dbt mart models we've created for AIS data analysis. We'll create two main visualizations:
1. A pie chart showing daily navigational status distribution
2. A time series visualization showing monthly navigational status trends over time

## Prerequisites
- Access to Google Cloud Console and the BigQuery project (`de-zoomcamp-project-455806`)
- The dbt models have been successfully run and data is available in BigQuery
- Access to Looker Studio (looker.google.com)

## Step 1: Access Looker Studio

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account that has access to the BigQuery project
3. From the Looker Studio homepage, click on the "+ Create" button and select "Report"

## Step 2: Connect to BigQuery Data Source

1. In the "Add data to report" dialog, select "BigQuery" as the connector
2. Choose "Custom Query" option
3. Select your project (`de-zoomcamp-project-455806`) from the dropdown
4. You'll need to create two separate data sources for our two visualizations:

### Data Source 1: Daily Navigational Status
1. Create a custom query:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     date,
     navigational_status,
     record_count,
     total_daily_records,
     percentage
   FROM
     `de-zoomcamp-project-455806.marts.daily_navigational_status`
   ```
2. Click "Run Query" to verify the data
3. Click "Add" to add this data source to your report
4. Rename the data source to "Daily Navigational Status"

### Data Source 2: Monthly Navigational Status
1. After adding the first data source, click "Add data" from the report toolbar
2. Follow the same steps but with this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     month_start_date,
     year,
     month,
     navigational_status,
     record_count,
     total_monthly_records,
     percentage
   FROM
     `de-zoomcamp-project-455806.marts.monthly_navigational_status`
   ORDER BY
     month_start_date, navigational_status
   ```
3. Click "Add" to add this data source
4. Rename the data source to "Monthly Navigational Status"

## Step 3: Create Daily Navigational Status Pie Chart

1. From the report editor, click "Add a chart" from the toolbar and select "Pie chart"
2. In the data panel on the right, ensure "Daily Navigational Status" is selected as the data source
3. Configure the chart dimensions and metrics:
   - Dimension: Add "navigational_status"
   - Metric: Add "percentage"
4. Configure style options:
   - Chart: Set an appropriate title (e.g., "Daily Navigational Status Distribution")
   - Slice: Enable "Show data labels" with value "Percentage"
   - Colors: Choose a diverse color palette to distinguish different statuses
   
## Step 4: Add Date Filter Control for Daily Chart

1. Click "Add a control" from the toolbar and select "Date range control"
2. Configure the control:
   - Data source: "Daily Navigational Status"
   - Date dimension: "date"
   - Default date range: Set to a recent period (e.g., last 30 days)
3. Position the control above the pie chart
4. In the pie chart's properties, ensure it's set to be controlled by this date filter

## Step 5: Create Monthly Navigational Status Time Series

1. Add a new page to your report by clicking the "+" button at the bottom of the page
2. Click "Add a chart" and select "Time series chart"
3. In the data panel, select "Monthly Navigational Status" as the data source
4. Configure the chart dimensions and metrics:
   - Dimension: Add "month_start_date"
   - Breakdown Dimension: Add "navigational_status"
   - Metric: Add "percentage"
5. Configure style options:
   - Chart: Set an appropriate title (e.g., "Monthly Navigational Status Trends")
   - Series: Choose "Stacked column" or "Stacked area" for better visualization of distributions
   - Colors: Use the same color palette as your pie chart for consistency

## Step 6: Add Date Range Control for Monthly Chart

1. Click "Add a control" and select "Date range control"
2. Configure the control:
   - Data source: "Monthly Navigational Status"
   - Date dimension: "month_start_date"
   - Default date range: Set to a suitable range (e.g., last 12 months)
3. Position the control above the time series chart
4. Ensure the chart is set to be controlled by this date filter

## Step 7: Add Navigational Status Filter

1. Click "Add a control" and select "Drop-down list"
2. Configure the control:
   - Position it in a location accessible to both charts (perhaps in a header section)
   - For the Daily chart page:
     - Data source: "Daily Navigational Status"
     - Control field: "navigational_status"
     - Specify "Include All option"
   - For the Monthly chart page, create a separate but similar filter:
     - Data source: "Monthly Navigational Status"
     - Control field: "navigational_status"
     - Specify "Include All option"

## Step 8: Add Context and Documentation

1. Click "Add a text" from the toolbar
2. Add descriptive text to explain:
   - What AIS data represents
   - What navigational status indicates
   - How to interpret the visualizations
   - Any caveats or limitations of the data
3. Position this text above or beside your visualizations
4. For example:
   ```
   AIS Navigational Status Analysis
   
   This dashboard presents analysis of ship navigational status data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) transmissions.
   
   The pie chart shows the distribution of different navigational statuses for a specific day.
   The time series chart shows how this distribution changes over months.
   
   Common navigational statuses include:
   - Under way using engine (0)
   - At anchor (1)
   - Not under command (2)
   - Restricted maneuverability (3)
   - Constrained by draft (4)
   - Moored (5)
   - Aground (6)
   - Engaged in fishing (7)
   - Under way sailing (8)
   ```

## Step 9: Add Summary Metrics

1. Click "Add a chart" and select "Scorecard"
2. Create separate scorecards for:
   - Total records in the selected period
   - Percentage of most common navigational status
   - Count of unique navigational statuses observed
3. Position these scorecards in a prominent location (e.g., top of the report)

## Step 10: Optimize Performance

1. Click on "Resource" in the menu and select "Manage data source"
2. For each data source:
   - Click "Edit" then navigate to "Data freshness and caching"
   - Set an appropriate cache duration (e.g., 4 hours or daily)
3. Add default date filters to limit initial data load
4. Consider adding filter suggestions in the text box to guide users toward efficient queries

## Step 11: Theme and Format

1. Click on "Theme" in the menu
2. Select a professional theme that aligns with project branding
3. Customize colors, fonts, and borders as needed
4. Ensure consistent formatting across all visualizations
5. Add a header with the project name and last update date

## Step 12: Share and Publish

1. Click "Share" in the top-right corner
2. Configure sharing settings:
   - Add specific people who need access
   - Set appropriate permissions (view only or edit)
   - Enable embedding if needed
3. Consider schedule email delivery for key stakeholders
4. Click "Publish" to make the dashboard accessible via link

## Testing and Validation

Before finalizing the dashboard:

1. Test all filters to ensure they work as expected
2. Verify that data matches expected values from BigQuery
3. Check performance with different date ranges
4. Test on different devices and screen sizes
5. Get feedback from potential users

## Maintenance Considerations

- Monitor query performance and optimize as needed
- Update dashboard annotations if data models change
- Consider adding automated anomaly detection
- Add data quality indicators if issues arise

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive approach to creating effective Looker Studio dashboards for AIS data analysis. The resulting dashboards will enable users to explore navigational status patterns both daily (via pie chart) and over time (via time series), providing valuable insights into maritime traffic behavior.
